Here is a more detailed 350-word description of the program:

Program Description
This console-based program is designed for students to enter their personal information, such as name and student ID, and answer a series of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The program runs entirely in the console environment, making it suitable for educational settings where quick and straightforward quiz-taking is needed without the complexity of a graphical user interface (GUI) or internet access.

Key Features:
Student Information Input: At the start, the program prompts students to input their name and student ID. This data is essential for identifying each student and tracking their responses throughout the quiz.

MCQ Quiz Functionality: The program then presents a set of multiple-choice questions. Each question is accompanied by several options (e.g., A, B, C, D), and the student must select the correct answer. The quiz is designed to accommodate any number of questions, providing flexibility for educators to adjust the quiz length as needed.

Answer Modification Capability: A standout feature of this system is its ability to allow students to revisit previous questions and modify their answers before the final submission. This feature encourages careful consideration and provides a more forgiving quiz environment where students can review and ensure their answers are accurate.

Error Handling and Input Validation: The program includes robust error-handling mechanisms to manage invalid inputs. For example, if a student enters an option that does not exist (e.g., 'E' for a question with only four choices), the system will alert the student and prompt them to enter a valid option. This ensures a smooth user experience and minimizes disruptions during the quiz.

Scoring and Feedback System: After all questions have been answered and reviewed, the program calculates the total score by comparing the student's answers with the correct ones stored in the system. It then displays the score along with feedback based on the student's performance, providing insights into their understanding of the material.

Practical Application: This console-based program is ideal for teachers who need a straightforward tool to conduct quizzes or tests. It combines simplicity with functionality, ensuring both ease of use and effective learning outcomes.

Overall, this system is a user-friendly solution for conducting MCQ quizzes in an educational setting, emphasizing flexibility, error management, and comprehensive feedback.
