Program Description
This console-based program allows students to enter their name and student ID, then answer a series of multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The program runs entirely in the console and guides the user through each step interactively. It is designed for use in educational settings to conduct quizzes or practice tests without needing an internet connection.

Features:
Student Information Input: The program first prompts the student to enter their name and student ID, which is recorded for identification purposes.

MCQ Quiz: After entering their details, the student is presented with a set of multiple-choice questions. Each question has several options (e.g., A, B, C, D), and the student is required to input their chosen answer.

Answer Modification: The system allows students to go back to previous questions to modify their answers before submitting the quiz. This feature provides flexibility, ensuring that students can review and change their responses as needed.

Error Handling: The program includes error handling to manage invalid inputs, such as entering a non-existent option for a question. It will prompt the student to re-enter a valid answer if an invalid input is detected, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Scoring System: At the end of the quiz, the program displays the studentâ€™s score, indicating the number of correct answers out of the total number of questions.

Usage:
1. This program is ideal for educational purposes where a quick and simple console-based quiz is needed.
